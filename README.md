# architecture_diagram_DrawIO
This repository contains diagrams (pdf) and their XML files (.io) that I created during my Ph.D.

I am using Draw.io online/desktop software for creating these diagrams. It is free, and you can access it from here https://app.diagrams.net/! These two folders contain editable xml files and their pdf versions. You can edit and play with them. This repo's main aim is to familiarize you with good diagram creation components.

Remember a few points:
1. I used Python (Matplotlib) and MS Powerpoint for graphs and other statistics.
2. Use good-quality images to be included in your figures.
3. Use the 'mathematical typesetting' option in draw.io to convert your equation into latex format.
4. Save your figure in .pdf format (preferred) or in .svg format. The rest of the formats are not good for quality.
5. If you are saving graphs and bar charts using Python, use .svg format (600=dpi), then paste this SVG into this software and convert it into pdf.
